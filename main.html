    <h1>HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
    <p>
      HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single
      request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by
      using multiplexing. HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the
      sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.

    <h1>objects and its internal representation</h1>
    <p>
      objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related
      data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
      These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and
      methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
